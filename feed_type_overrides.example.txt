# Feed Type Overrides
#
# This file allows you to manually override the automatic feed type detection.
# Use this when Ollama AI misclassifies a feed or you want to force a specific type.
#
# Format: feed_url = type
#   - feed_url: The full RSS feed URL (must match exactly)
#   - type: Either 'comic' or 'news'
#
# Examples:
#   https://example.com/rss = comic
#   https://another-site.com/feed.xml = news
#
# Notes:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Whitespace around URLs and types is automatically trimmed
#   - URLs must match exactly (case-sensitive)
#   - Invalid lines will be logged as warnings but won't stop processing
#
# Priority Order (highest to lowest):
#   1. Manual overrides (this file) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
#   2. Explicit FEED_TYPES config (hardcoded in src/config.py)
#   3. Cache (.feed_type_cache.json)
#   4. Ollama AI detection
#   5. Default to 'comic' (fallback)
#
# To use this file:
#   1. Copy this file to 'feed_type_overrides.txt' in the project root
#   2. Add your overrides below (one per line)
#   3. Save the file
#   4. Run the RSS processor - your overrides will take effect immediately
#
# Example overrides (uncomment and modify as needed):
# https://questionablecontent.net/QCRSS.xml = comic
# https://macitynet.it/feed/ = news
