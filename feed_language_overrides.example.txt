# Feed Language Override Configuration
#
# This file allows you to manually specify the language for any feed domain.
# Manual overrides take HIGHEST priority (above cache and AI detection).
#
# Format: domain_or_url = language
#
# You can use either:
#   - Just the domain: macitynet.it = Italian
#   - Full URL: https://www.macitynet.it/feed/ = Italian
#
# Language names should be in English (e.g., "English", "Italian", "Spanish", "Chinese")
#
# Examples:
# macitynet.it = Italian
# feedburner.com/psblog = Italian
# 9to5mac.com = English
# lemonde.fr = French
# elpais.com = Spanish
# spiegel.de = German
# asahi.com = Japanese
# chinadaily.com.cn = Chinese
#
